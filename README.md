The purpose of this program is to take an input text file that contains a list of products. The program will parse through the text file and
create an object of each of the products containing their properties and place them into a List.  The products will be assigned
a TaxID that is determined by keywords in the name, such as chocolate or imported, so that a tax can be applied
where applicable.  Once finished, the result will be shown in a dialogue containing the product's properties
and with the total tax and total cost.  The user will have the option to save the list to a text file.

How to Run:
Ensure the Cashier.jar and the CashierDriver.bat are in the same directory.
